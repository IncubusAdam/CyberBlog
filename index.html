        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Adam!</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a writer at heart. My ideas and thoughts don’t feel concrete unless they’ve been typed or written somewhere. My memory is pretty good, but ideas come and go. Better to have it written down to rekindle the creative spark it originally came from than to let that fire burn and die to never be started again. The world of Cyber moves quickly forward but I strongly believe in the saying “Those that don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” Hopefully, leaving a trail of ideas and thoughts will make my future clear and understandable. At the least, I can look back and see how far I have come.

                <h3>A Monster Made Real</h3>
                <h4>Ransomeware, Cybersecurity</h4>
                <p>Ransomware always felt mystical to me. A far-off worry, never real. The idea that hackers could encrypt my data and demand payment from me to get it back was ridiculous. It happened to my brother’s employer, Nexon. Nexon cleans and distributes chemicals for New England, and during my brother’s time there they fell victim to ransomware. The systems that logged orders, both new and filled, were encrypted. They couldn’t work and were forced to menial upkeep or simply not working at all. The source was either unidentified or not disclosed, but hearing about it from my brother made ransomware real to me. This vague monster that lived in the back of my mind suddenly seemed clear. It only helped push me further toward cybersecurity and understanding the necessity of its practices.

                <h3>Safe or Easy?</h3>
                <h4>Accessability, Security</h4>
                <p>
                    The balance of security and accessibility is a delicate one. Something that is 100% secure is not accessible and something that is 100% accessible is not secure. Somewhere in this middle ground is where companies must put their systems, their frontend services, their compounds, and their servers. The more I learn about what’s out there, the malicious actors and potential threats lurking, the more cautious I become. The more I learn toward security. Finding this happy medium, I feel will be a challenge, but one I am welcome to.
